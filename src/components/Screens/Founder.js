  <summary>How to find an angel investor for my startup?</summary>
  <div className="faq__content">
    <p>The best way to find investors is to find customers. If can you cant find customers, you will not be able to find investors. Once you see some traction, revenue and feel that you have a MSP ( minimum sellable product ), then you can start looking at investors. Note that early stage capital is very expensive and angel funds will take a significant chunk of your company. </p>
